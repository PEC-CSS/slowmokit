# Activation Functions 

Sigmoid-It is computationally expensive, causes vanishing gradient problem and not zero-centred. This method is generally used for binary classification problems.

tanh- The Tanh activation function is a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function that has a range of -1 to 1. It is often used in deep learning models for its ability to model nonlinear boundaries

arctan-The ArcTan function is a sigmoid function to model accelerating and decelerating outputs but with useful output ranges.This activation function maps the input values in the range (−π/2,π/2). Its derivative converges quadratically against 0 for large input values.

ReLU-This The ReLU activation function returns 0 if the input value to the function is less than 0 but for any positive input, the output is the same as the input. It is also continuous but non-differentiable at 0 and at values less than 0 because its derivative is 0 for any negative input.

leakyReLU- With Leaky ReLU there is a small negative slope so instead of that firing at all, for large gradients, our neurons do output some value and that makes our layer much more optimized too.

softmax-The softmax is a more generalised form of the sigmoid. It is used in multi-class classification problems. Similar to sigmoid, it produces values in the range of 0–1 therefore it is used as the final layer in classification models.

binaryStep-The Step activation function is used in the perceptron network. This is usually used in single-layer networks to convert to an output that is binary (0 or 1).These are called Binary Step Function.


The following function definitions are defined for a single variable for making it comprehendible and are implemented for a vector of 'double' values in the original code.
